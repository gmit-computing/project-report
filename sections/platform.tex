\label{chapter:platform}

In this section we discuss the selection of a platform on which to build our prototype.
Table \ref{table:selection} is a bit big.

      Criterion &
      Option A &
      Option B &
      Option C \\
    \midrule
      Maintain &
      No real maintenance. &
      Easy to maintain; easy to find help. &
      Extensive technical expertise required. \\
    \midrule
      Customise &
      Generally only branding can be customised. &
      Theming and plugins provide significant customisation; lower-level customisations possible but not advised. &
      Total control over customisations, but can be onerous. \\
    \midrule
      Resilience &
      Based on the vendor's own resilience and their investment in the platform. & 
      Selection of a popular platform ensures on-going reilience. &
      Depends on all technologies used, can be volatile. \\
    \midrule
      Community &
      Depends on size of social network -- community often limited with some notable exceptions such as Facebook. &
      Large communities already established for many products. &
      Segmented community across each technology involved. \\
    \midrule
      Reliable &
      Extremely reliable, often based on Service Level Agreements. &
      Very reliable as the platforms are well established. &
      Dependent on social network maintainer's ability to ensure reliability. \\
